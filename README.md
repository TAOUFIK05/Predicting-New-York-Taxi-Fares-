This project involves predicting the fares of New York taxi rides trees and random forests.The project utilizes a dataset consisting of a large number of taxi journeys from 2013 and focuses on predicting the fare and tip values based on location, date, and time. The dataset used is a sample from the complete 2013 NYC taxi data, and the project involves cleaning the data, zooming in on Manhattan, and exploring where taxi journeys begin. The project also involves using multiple regression trees and random forests to predict fares and tips more accurately. By the end of the project, the predicted fares and actual fares are plotted to determine where people spend the most.
