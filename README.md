This project involves predicting the fares of New York taxi rides trees and random forests.The project utilizes a dataset consisting of a large number of taxi journeys from 2013 and focuses on predicting the fare and tip values based on location, date, and time. The dataset used is a sample from the complete 2013 NYC taxi data, and the project involves cleaning the data, zooming in on Manhattan, and exploring where taxi journeys begin. The project also involves using multiple regression trees and random forests to predict fares and tips more accurately. By the end of the project, the predicted fares and actual fares are plotted to determine where people spend the most.

## Project tasks:

1.Importing data (49999 taxi trips in New York)

2.Cleaning and preparing the taxi data for analysis

3.Focusing on Manhattan to narrow down the analysis area

4.Identifying the starting point of the taxi journeys

5.Building a random forest model to predict taxi fares

6.Incorporating additional predictors to improve the model

7.Evaluating the model and building an additional tree if necessary

8.Assessing whether one tree is sufficient or more are needed

9.Creating a visualization of the predicted taxi fares

10.Creating a visualization of the actual taxi fares

11.Analyzing where passengers spend the most on taxi trips.

# Good to know
This project was implemented using the R programming language, assuming that you have used the dplyr and ggplot2 packages.

#Data :

The data is in the file :

### taxi.csv :
